## **GPT Model From Scratch**

- The project involves the development of a Generatively Pretrained Transformer (GPT) model inspired by the paper ["Attention is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf) and OpenAI's GPT-2/GPT-3.
- The model is trained using the "tinyshakespear" dataset, which likely contains text data associated with the works of William Shakespeare.

- The primary goal of this project is to create a language model that can generate coherent and contextually relevant responses in a writing style reminiscent of Shakespeare.
- The underlying architecture is based on the transformer model, which has proven to be highly effective in natural language processing tasks.
- The transformer model's attention mechanism allows the model to capture intricate patterns and dependencies in the input data, enabling it to generate human-like text.

- The choice of the "tinyshakespear" dataset implies that the model is specifically tailored to mimic the language and style characteristic of Shakespearean writing.
- This could involve using archaic language, poetic structures, and other features associated with Shakespeare's works.

- In practical terms, the trained GPT model should be capable of taking input prompts or questions and generating responses that align with the distinctive writing style of Shakespeare.
- This could have applications in creative writing, chatbots, or other areas where generating text in a specific style is desired.
- The model essentially acts as a text generator that produces outputs in a manner consistent with the linguistic and stylistic nuances of Shakespearean literature.
